## Evaluate Python Code (`,r`)

Documents which can "do" stuff may come handy sometimes - this is python centric approach.

üëì General statement: _Try use **built in** mechanics instead of plugins - they are *pretty* powerful:_

- vim/neovim [can][hot] 'hot evaluate' code using e.g. `:py print("hello")` or `:!ls -lta /`.
- Also it can insert files into the buffer quite easily: `:read /etc/hosts`
- It can also redir command output into the current buffer (`h redir`)
- (...)

[hot]: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Execute_Python_from_within_current_file

This plugin offers

- Output handling
  - within a split window (a buffer, incl. undo history) or inline
  - as valid python (i.e. with lsp support, e.g. for re-formatting)
- Various [evaluation and output control directives](#directives)
- Loadable predefined python code blocks
- Hot reload of this plugin's python module code, w/o state loss
- Some convience regarding evaluation of lines within code blocks
- Testing functions

Also, the module offers [built in support](./docs/swagger.md) for interaction with Swagger/OpenAPI APIs

![](./docs/img/swagger.png)

...and much more.

### Setup

Config: Map `,r` in normal and visual mode to `PythonEval`.

### Usage Evaluate

- Hit the hotkey (e.g. `,r`) on a line, lines or visually selected range, which you want evaluated.
- By default we evaluate as python, except when you hint otherwise (see below)
- If the evaluated line is part of a block (e.g. a line within a function), then the whole block is evaluated by default.
- When the evaluated python block contains assignments to `p` or `y`, their values are shown pretty printed
  or as yaml within a vertical split window. As are evaluation errors.
- Invocations of the `print` function result in print outs within vim's status window.
- Previously evaluated lines are remembered, i.e. state is kept between evaluations.
- Objects or classes within result structures are walked for their attributes, when printing them

Notes:

- Evaluated code may even reside within docstrings or markdown code blocks - as long as you omit the
  comment delimiters from the evaluation, all assignements make it into the next evaluation state.
- vim calls the python code syncronously, blocking. You have to kill the python process to unblock
  it, should your code block forever, while executing.

### Features

#### Directives

Supported (in python mode usually after comment tags '#') are:

- `:[no]always`: When set, then all directives of this eval run are remembered for future runs, until `:noalways` is set
- `:[no]autodoc`: The `:doc` directive is set/removed for all subsequent evaluations
- `:all`: The whole source module is evaluated before the single line is
- `:clear`: The previous result is removed
- `:cmt <comment>`: Show the given comment string
- `:doc`: Show the evaluated block in the result window
- `:ft`: Set filetype of result window
- `:here`: Show the result under the current line in the source buffer (no split)
- `:nofmt`: If set _no_ lsp format of result window
- `:reload`: Reload the module, keep ctx.state. Comes handy testing code changes.
- `:silent`: Skip showing results at all
- `:single`: Only the line on the cursor is evaluated, even if within a bigger block (see swagger)
- `:state`: Add the evaluation state to result (shows all assigned variables)
- `:stop`: Evaluate only to this point in a block
- `:vpe_on_any`: Occurring at header or footer of files (3 lines), this line will be evaluated if no python under cursor
- `:vpe_on_err`: Occurring at header or footer of files (10 lines), this line will be evaluated on exceptions
- `:wrap <code>`: The line is wrapped into code, replacing the string '{}' (see swagger)

#### Result Display

Assign the following variables and evaluate to influence how results are shown:

- `p = <result>` or `y = <result>`: Pretty print or yaml dump any object, incl. attributes
- `filter="<list of match strings>"`: Recursively scans the result structure and only shows key OR
  values (substring-)matching any of the filter.
  A filter value '1' results in all list reduced to their first item.
- `hide="<list of match strings>"`: Recursively scans the result structure and "x-out" values, whose
  keys(!) match any of the hide strings. Intended to not show passwords and the like in demos.

```python :clear
filter = 'bar,1'
hide = 'bar'
m = {'u': 23, 'a': [{'foo': {'bar': 23, 'baz': 23}}, {'other': 42}]}
p = m   # :doc
```

result pane:

```python
# 2 keys filtered, matching [bar,1]
p = {'a': [{'foo': {'bar': 'xxx'}}, '...[2 items]]}
```

Note: When you set `:here` then the result will be NOT shown in a split window but within
the source buffer, below the current line.

#### Predefined Blocks (Macros)

Note: At this time this feature does NOT offer anything more than a good snippets tool, i.e. you
probably do NOT need it. I was just adding it, in order to have those available on `cow style` machines
without a sophisticated vim setup.

If you hit the hotkey on an empty line we present a list of predefined code blocks, for quick adds
into the source code window.

You may extend that list by your own "macros" like so:

```python
~ ‚ùØ cat .config/vpe/macros.py
d = """
'Demo user macro'
import time
print('Hello', time.time())
"""

macros = {'demo': d}
```

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/057ewOGytqJDGEL6DF9Ck1hDw.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/057ewOGytqJDGEL6DF9Ck1hDw)

#### Markdown Fenced Blocks

Fenced code blocks are evaluated in total if you evaluate the first line, starting with 3 fences
(also indented)

````
    ```python  :clear :always
    import os
    p = os.popen('uname -a').read()
    ``

````

Since state is kept also cross buffers, you might e.g. define helper functions for presentations
centrally, which you can later use in your presentation files.

#### Global Variables

Under the namespace class `vpe` the following variables are always available at python execution time:

üëì Eval this to access them:

```python
p = dir(vpe)
```

##### vpe.vim

Access to the pynvim API. Alternative: `import vim`.

```python
p = vpe.vim.version #:here
# prints when evaluated:
p = Version(api_compatible=0, api_level=10, api_prerelease=False, major=0, minor=8, patch=1, prerelease=False)
```

##### vpe.ctx

- `ctx`.`state`: Evaluation state
- `ctx`.`src_buf`: Reference to source buffer
- `ctx`.`L1`, `L2`: Lines selected
- `ctx`.`W`: The visually selected words (if any)
- `ctx`.`PTH`: The full file path
- `ctx`.`COL`: The first column of visual selection

You can explore those e.g. via `p = dir(ctx) # :here`

##### vpe.cmd

```python
vpe(<vim cmd>, silent=True, title=<False, True, string>, opt='')
```

Executes vim command and redirects to a file. The file is then ALWAYS redirected to the
current buffer, relative to current line. `opt` forwarded to the read as opt (`:h read`).

##### vpe.fnd

Convenience function to deliver dir and full path of source buffer:

    vpe.fnd().here  / vpe.fnd().fn

‚ùóIf you `os.chdir`, be aware that this happens in a python subprocess of vi. Vi itself does not change dir.

=> Use sth like this in vim.cmd: `vpe.cmd(f'edit {os.getcwd()}/myfile')`

##### vpe.notify

Calls the notify-send utility.
If you use growl or other tools, symlink or wrap them e.g. at `/usr/local/bin/notify-send`

```python
vpe.notify('title', 'optional msg') # calls notify-send "title" "o. msg"
```

##### vpe.hlp.insert_between

Helper to insert text between markers in the buffer.

Example

Within the document add 2 insert markers, e.g.:

```
<!-- beg insert1 -->
<!-- end insert1 -->
```

then you can (re-) evaluate a string and (re-)insert it between the markers like so

````
 ```python :silent
 t, a = 'hi\nthere', 'insert1'
 vpe.hlp.insert_between(f'beg {a} -->', '<!-- end {a}', t)
 ```
````

Existing content between the markers will be overwritten by the new stuff.

üí° Using `vpe_on_any` you can re-evaluate the insertion code via `,r` from anywhere in the document.

## Empty Line Handling / Help

- When no result window open: Open it, showing help
- Otherwise: Close result window

## Modules

Call syntax (in vim):

`<module name>  [argument]`, at column 1 of any line of a buffer, then eval hotkey (e.g. `,r`)

This hands over evaluation to modules, doing specific things with the args.

## Module Help

hotkey on module name without args.

## CLI

Some modules make some sense to be called outside vim as well, syntax like this:

```bash
alias vpe=<path to this repo>/plugin/vim_python_eval.py
vpe <module name> [argument]`
```

## Non Python Evaluation: EvalInto

A function evaluating _anything_ vim can do in ex mode (e.g. `!ls -lta`) into a split window is also included.

See [here](./docs/eval_into.md) for details.

## Pickers

Hotkey over prosa words anywhere in a line will result in the evaluation to fail. Absent a
`vpe_on_err` directive, vpe proceeds to open a telescope picker with certain options,
about what to do with the word.

Those options are found, based on modules available or linked within the
`vpe/plugin/modules/pickermods` directory.

## Smart Goto

### Usage Smart Goto

Vim or a browser will open according to cursor position or selected range.

See [here](./docs/smart_goto.md) for details.

## Jump References

Evaluating something like `:/foo.bar/` (at the beginning of a line) or `:vpe /foo.bar/`
(anywhere in a line) tries to find all lines below, (regex)matching `.*foo.bar` and evaluate, as if it was the cursor line
when hitting the hotkey.

This way you can hide code away, e.g. in presentations but still have it available.

If you say `/gg/foo.bar/` then searching for matches will happen not from the line with
the jump declaration but from the beginning of the file.

That way you can have a jump ref at the end of the file, possibly with a `:vpe_on_err` or `:vpe_on_any` directive.

Note: Directives `:vpe_on_err` or `:vpe_on_any` are understood behind ` # :` seperator (but before a closing `-->`)

### Sample Use Cases

```
 # My Live Markdown Doc
 ...
 func1()

 <!-- Code defined below, not visible for the viewer
 `` python @prepare-presentation
 # python code, executed when ,r is pressed *anywhere* (through vpe_on_any below)>
 vpe.on_any = False # disable for subsequent ,r in this whole vi session (until enabled again)
 func1 = lambda: do_something_useful() # will happen when u hit ,r on the line with func1 above
 ``

 :vpe /gg/@prepare-presentation/ # :vpe_on_any
 vi: fdl=1 fen
 end of document -->
```

## Installation

1. Install this plugin, i.e. "axiros/vpe", using your fav. package mgr.
2. Configuration:

Define a hotkey for invoking it in normal and extended mode, e.g.:

```lua
mode n:
        [',r'] = { ":call PyEvalSelection('Eval', '')<CR>"}
        [',g'] = { ":silent call PyEvalSelection('SmartGoto', '')<CR>"}
mode x:
        [',r'] = { ":<C-U> call PyEvalSelection('Eval', visualmode())<CR>"}
        [',g'] = { ":<C-U> silent call PyEvalSelection('SmartGoto', visualmode())<CR>"}
```

This lazy loads the module on first use.

Naturally, those shortcuts are just suggestions.

### Requirements

- Should work for vim and neovim with python3 support but tested only in neovim
- Autoformatting of results only in neovim.
- For filetype python we assume these requirements in your config:
- `set foldmethod=indent` should be set for python, since we collapse classes after creating swagger
  support definitions.

## Developing

Set `let g:vpe_reload=1` to enable reloading the module at every invokation.
State, e.g. evaluated imports, is kept in dict `ctx.state`.

Modules can be tested better using the command line syntax.

### Automatic Testing

They require a [pds](https://github.com/AXGKl/pds) sandbox on your system, for test tools support.

Then you can [automate testing](./tests/test_pds.sh) based on a real vi running in tmux.

## Troubleshooting

### A lib in my venv/conda env cannot be imported

1. pynvim (or neovim), the vim api we use, is usually installed into somewhere like `~.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pynvim`.
2. thy `python3` command of [n]vim searches your $PATH for the available python of that major
   version. It might decide to use the wrong one, if your venv's version does not match.

You can evaluate `p = sys.executable, sys.path` to get more information about the python in use
within [n]vim.

Example result:

```python
p = (
    '/home/gk/nvim/bin/python3',
    [
        '/home/gk/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/vpe/plugin',
        '/home/gk/nvim/lib/python310.zip',
        '/home/gk/nvim/lib/python3.10',
        '/home/gk/nvim/lib/python3.10/lib-dynload',
        '/home/gk/nvim/lib/python3.10/site-packages',
        '_vim_path_',
    ],
)
```

=> You can try `pip install pynvim` or `pip install neovim` version for your python OR pull the venv up or down to the
major you have for pynvim.

### gevent monkey patch causes trouble

If evaluated code wants to "monkey patch" the whole interpreter, then [n]vim fails with an error
message about execution outside the main thread.

Workaround:

If you cannot avoid the monkey path, then try command out the check in nvim.py's request function:

```python
        # if (self._session._loop_thread is not None
        #         and threading.current_thread() != self._session._loop_thread):
        #     msg = ("Request from non-main thread.\n"...)
        #     self.async_call(self._err_cb, msg)
        #     raise NvimError("request from non-main thread")
```
